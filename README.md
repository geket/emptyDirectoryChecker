# emptyDirectoryChecker
A bash/shell script written for GNU Linux to scan for empty directories, enumerate contents of said directories and then finally prompts the user whether they would like to remove them. This was inspired by Remove Empty Directories (RED) for Windows. Generated by ChatGPT.

# Usage
To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. empty-dir-check.sh), make it executable with `chmod +x empty-dir-check.sh`, and run it with `./empty-dir-check.sh`.

The script will prompt you to enter a path to scan for empty directories. If the path is valid, it will find all empty directories in that path, list them, and enumerate the number of files they contain. Then, it will prompt you to confirm if you want to delete the empty directories. If you choose to delete them, the script will remove them from the file system.
